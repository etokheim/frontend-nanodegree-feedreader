# Feed reader testing
*(This assignment is part of the Frontend developer degree at Udacity)*

For this assignment I wrote a test suite using Jasmine to test several features of the pre-written webpage in this repository. The test suite is a debugging tool, which tells the developer if everything is working correctly or not. If not, it displays useful error messages.

If you want to check out the test report, the results are integrated at the bottom of the webpage. Just visit [this link](https://etokheim.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/) or clone/download the project files.

## Download
To download click the "Clone or download" button and "Download ZIP" or clone the repository by copying the URL and pasting it into your terminal (you need to install git first) like this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/etokheim/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
```
