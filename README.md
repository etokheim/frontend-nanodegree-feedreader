# Feed reader testing
*(This assignment is part of the Frontend developer degree at Udacity)*

For this assignment I wrote a test suite using Jasmine to test several features of the pre-written webpage in this repository. The test suite is a debugging tool, which tells the developer if everything is working correctly or not. If not, it displays useful error messages.

If you want to check out the test report, the results are integrated at the bottom of the webpage. Just visit [this link](https://etokheim.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/) or clone/download the project files.

## Download and run
### If you don't have Git installed
1. Click the "Clone or download" button and "Download ZIP"
2. Unzip folder
3. Open index.html

### If you have Git installed
If you have Git installed you can clone the repository by copying the URL (from the "Clone or download" button) and pasting it into your terminal like this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/etokheim/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
```

Then open the index.html file.
